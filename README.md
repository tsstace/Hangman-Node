# Hangman-Node style

This node application allows the user to play a "Clue" board game themed word guessing game in the console window.  The target word is displayed with underscores and is updated as the user enters letters.  In addition, the banner displays the letters guessed and the number of guesses remaining every time the user hits the enter key.  The game performs simple input validation to restrict entry to alphabetic characters and prevent repeat entry of the same letter.

# Node packages included:
- inquirer
- file-saver
